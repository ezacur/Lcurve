# Lcurve
Tool for Lcurve criteria in Tikhonov regularization


Here we include a general purpose tool in Matlab for the evaluation of the curvature of an Lcurve. The curvature is computed in *analytic* form.

The tool also allows for searching the optimal knee region and solves the regularized regression in a simple and concise manner.

For more information, follow the "testing_Lcurve.m" script. Even more details are in the help section in **Lcurve.m**.
